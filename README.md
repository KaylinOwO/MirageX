# MirageX

An extremely simple DLC unlocker for Steamworks.

# Installation  

You can use any DLL injector, but for convenience, I recommend [ThirteenAG's Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) or any DLL/mod loader of your choice.  

### Steps:  
- Download and extract the [ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/latest) to the same folder as your target application's `.exe`.  
- Download and extract [MirageX](https://github.com/KaylinOwO/MirageX/releases/latest) into the same folder.  
- Boot the game. Simple as that! :D 

#### **Note:** Use the x64 version of both Ultimate ASI Loader and MirageX if your target application is x64, and the x86 versions if it's 32-bit.  

# Q&A

 - #### Does this work on multiplayer games?
    - Highly depends but in most cases, no. If the game has an anti-cheat this will very likely get you banned. 

 - #### Will this work on X/Y/Z Game?
    - No way to know for sure but I have tested on quite a number of games. If you found one that it doesn't work in then create a GitHub Issue and I'll look into it.
